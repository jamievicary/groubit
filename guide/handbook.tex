\section{Qubits}

\paragraph{What is a qubit?}

Scientists around the world are racing to build the first quantum computer, which will use the laws of quantum mechanics to solve some problems much faster than any computer we have now. Using your very own qubit, we can investigate some of the 

While today's computers store information using bits, quantum computers will store information using qubits

...

 - A qubit is the basic building block of a quantum computer
 
 - Measure, one-qubit operations, two-qubit operations
 
 - Using the cable
 
 - All the operations cancel themselves out if you do them twice. So if you press one by accident, press it again
 
 \section{Measurement}
 
You can ask a qubit the following question: ``what state are you in?''. The answer will be 0 or 1.

\section{Superposition}



\section{Entanglement}

Two entangled qubits will behave the same way, however far separated they are in space.

\paragraph{Experiment.} Entangle two qubits, then measure each of them.

\section{Teleportation}

\paragraph{Experiment.} 

\section{Super Dense Coding}

We can use qubits to send messages, by
